		<br><p>A vision board is a powerful tool for turning your dreams into reality. It's like a collage that you create using images, words, and symbols that represent your goals, dreams, and desires. You can use magazines, printed pictures, or even draw your own images to put on your vision board. The idea is to choose things that resonate with you and inspire you to take action.

By putting your goals and dreams on a vision board, you're creating a visual representation of what you want to achieve in your life.
